  <h1> oggy and the cockroaches</h1>

  <p>Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework — when not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of love–hate relationship with them, having lived with them for a long time .</p>

  <p> In the episode "The Ghost Hunter", Oggy kills the cockroaches but is terrorized by the spirits. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode "Priceless Roaches" and "So Lonely") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. Oggy's house appears bigger on the inside, mainly featured in the roller coaster-like staircase scenes. According to executive producer Marc du Pontavice and France Info, the character of Oggy was named after punk rock musician Iggy Pop and the rock album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. In early episodes, Oggy, like his Tom and Jerry counterpart was the main punching bag in the series. However, in more recent episodes, Oggy has been portrayed as heroic, often triumphing over the cockroaches despite the beatings he takes from them and Bob. Notable other accomplish </p>

  <h1>olivia</h1>

  <p> Oggy returns back into the house, wearing an apron, and taking a cake out of the oven. The doorbell rings, and Oggy opens the door. His nose trembles, because Olivia is the one near. Oggy looks down and notices his apron, and immediately turns it around, embarrassingly. She then pulls up a card, giving it to him. He then looks at it, and then accepts it. Olivia accepts and waves goodbye, with Oggy doing the same thing. Though she left, Oggy still continues waving and is still at the position. Joey peeks beside Oggy, and tells the Dee Dee to hammer Oggy's tail, with Marky carrying Dee Dee. Joey goes near the two, and Dee Dee does so, so strongly it shakes the Earth. Joey laughs, but Oggy is still "paralyzed" at his position with his waving fingers. Dee Dee tries harder, but still doesn't work. Joey then takes the hammer and tries it on two, and it worked. Joey is then confused.</p>

  <p>Oggy then dresses up nicely, wearing a bow tie and combs his "ears for hair". He raises up his fat to look tough, but doesn't work. He tries again, fails, and does it again while holding it. He reaches to Olivia with flowers and food. He rings the bell with his foot, since his hands are full. Olivia speedingly runs to him, and has her hands near him. He looks at both items, reveals it, and kisses her hand. She takes the bouquet of flowers, and kisses him. He then stands still, the bowtie flies away, she tells him to follow her. He smiles with eyes apart, and does so. The cockroaches are then hiding in the basket, and pops out. Both Oggy and Olivia walks to her backyard, but Oggy stops. Only then to find out that Bob and Jack are already there. They greet Oggy, and he is then disappointed. He takes hand out to greet Bob. He then smiles, and proceeds to crush Oggy's hand. The cockroaches then step out of the basket. Episode ends.</p>
  <h1> jack </h1>
  <p> Jack can be easily described as the opposite of Oggy. He's quick-tempered, violent, focused, self-important, sometimes lazy, nasty, and mechanic. More often than not, he's focused on getting rid of the cockroaches or doing something selfish. Jack often builds something to try and destroy the cockroaches, or any other insect that roams Oggy's house—and while he has had some success, more often than not his plans backfire. He also sometimes bullies Oggy, either moving him when he's in front of the TV, trying to beat Oggy in a race, or just going plain insane. He is perhaps the easiest target in the show, mainly because his rage gets him too unfocused on either getting rid of the cockroaches.However at times, Jack can show his nicer side when he's not focused on stopping the cockroaches or acting villainous. He tends to play the "straight-man" to Oggy and the roaches' antics.</p>

  <h1> bob</h1>

  <p>Bob is a dark brown skinned dog with a gray tummy and a normal belly button, a large chin and a spiked leash (without a handle). He's a very strong, fierce bulldog. In his first appearance, his tail was a bit bendy. However, as of Heatwave and Under the Sun, it was changed to a stub.
  Personality</p>
  <div><img src="vhttps://media1.tenor.com/images/eb47c7ca861ddd5031e88c8d17f47820/tenor.gif?itemid=12759464" alt="">  <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C616bfL5Mf8/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></div>
  <p>Oggy's huge neighbor dog - though he's not mentioned in the opening credits – is one frequent star in the show. While Bob tries to live his life as quietly and calmly as possible, the next-door racket usually results in destruction of his property, for which he typically responds with pummeling one of the cats. This mostly happens off-screen. He tends to switch locations from Oggy's house, usually on the left side and across the road. Bob will sometimes befriends the cockroaches against Oggy, though sometimes is vice-versa or he turns enemies for both characters.      
  He is also known to like boxing and it is very obvious that Bob is very strong.<br>      
  In Season 4, he becomes friendlier to Oggy and Jack. </p>
